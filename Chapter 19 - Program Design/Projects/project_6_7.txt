Project 6:
Q. Modify Programming Project 5 so that the items in a queue are stored in a dynamically allocated array whose length is passed to the create function.
A. The given question is already done in Exercise 3(a). It contains the full queue ADT--with wrap around functionality--as well as a client file (exercise_3) which contains the implementation of the ADT.

Project 7:
Q. Modify Programming Project 5 so that the items in a queue are stored in a linked list (see Exercise 3(b)).
A. The given question is already done in Exercise 3(b). It contains the queue ADT implemented using linked list. The implementation of the queue ADT is shown in exercise_3.c file which contains two different queueADT implementations.
