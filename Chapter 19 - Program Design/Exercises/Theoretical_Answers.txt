Exercise 4:
Q.  a. Write an implementation of the Stack type, assuming that Stack is a structure containing a fixed-length array.
    b. Redo the Stack type, this time using a linked-list representation instead of an array. (Show both stack.h and stack.c.)
A.  Part a has been done when reading the chapter. It is located in the stack directory--specifically the `../stack/fixed_size/`--where the stack is implemented using the fixed size array.
    Part b has been done as well. It too is located in the stack directory (../stack/linked_list/).

Exercise 6:
Q.  a. Add a peak function to stackaADT.c. This function will have a parameter of type Stack. When called, it returns the top item on the stack but doesn't modify the stack.
    b. Repeat part (a), modifying stackADT2.c this time.
    c. Repeat part (a), modifying stackADT3.c this time.
A.  The function is added as an extension in:
    a. in `../stack/fixed_size/`
    b. in `../stack/dynamic_size/`
    c. in `../stack/linked_list/`
